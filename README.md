# Instagram-Scraper
This program is made using python and the selenium library, to scrape images off of Instagram hashtags or accounts.
To use this program please open the source code and alter the placeholder text with the instagram account login you would like to use.
You will also have to alter the placeholder text with the instagram hashtag or account that you would like to scrape.
You can also alter the scroll value (default is 4000) to scrape more or less images as needed. (Note increasing the scroll value scrolls further and thus scraped more images).
